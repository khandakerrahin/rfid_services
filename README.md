# Automated School Attendance System using UHF RFID Reader DL950S

The project aims to design and deploy an automated school attendance system using **UHF RFID Reader DL950S** where the RFID devices are deployed at the school premises and managed remotely using Raspberry Pi 3. For this project, I contributed to the development of the console applications from the provided SDK which involved configuring the devices, collecting and stream processing of the sensor readings, transferring the data to the inhouse datastore.
